      "ic_advanced": "The image centers on a 500-Chilean-peso coin, which stands out as the focal element of the composition. Surrounding it, the entire frame is filled exclusively with money, emphasizing a theme of currency and value. Beneath the coin lies a green banknote, most likely a 1,000-peso bill, partially visible and adding contrast in both color and texture. The metallic shine of the coin draws immediate attention, while the paper bill introduces a softer visual layer. The arrangement appears deliberate, as if meant to highlight the relationship between different denominations. The close-up perspective allows small details—edges, textures, and printing patterns—to be clearly observed. Overall, the scene conveys a simple yet focused depiction of Chilean currency."
